# about

This light tool is meant to create code-snippets for arduinos
controlling multiple motors. Motors can easily be added and
removed. The only restriction is the amount of pins available.

The generated code is not streamlined for performance or "good
code" but as verbose as possible for beginners who start off and
learn about the mechanics of code.

Created for the Creative Hacking course at the State Academy of
Art and Design Stuttgart.
